        <h2>What should I NOT eat</h2>
        <h3> A heart-healthy diet limits some nutrients. These include:</h3>
        <h4>Sodium.</h4>
        <p> foods with spices or no-salt seasonings instead of salt. Watch out for prepackaged foods, sauces, canned
          foods, and processed foods. They can all contain a high amount of sodium.</p>

        <h4>Saturated trans fats </h4>
        <p>Saturated fats are found in fatty meats, poultry skin, whole-milk dairy, butter, lard, and coconut and palm
          oils. Tans fats are found in some desserts, microwave popcorn, frozen pizza, stick margarines, and coffee
          creamers. Look for the words partially hydrogenated oil on the food label.</p>

        <h4>sugar</h4>
        <p>drinks, snacks, and sweet treats are the main source of added sugars in the United States. These include
          sodas, sweetened coffee and tea, energy drinks, cakes, pies, ice cream, candy, syrups, and jellies. Limit
          these types of foods and drinks.</p>

        <h4>Alcohol</h4>
        <p>Limit your intake of alcohol. Men should have no more than 2 drinks a day. Women should have no more than 1
          drink per day. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and cause you to gain weight. It can also
          contribute to or worsen heart failure in some people.</p>
